 but however shows no sadness almost seems  detached from the matter. Later in a complicated turn of events he prevents his friend from killing an arab guy who 
is the brother of his friend's mistress, who formerly cheated on him. But after some time he returns to the beach and shoots the arab guy without any explaination.
He's arrested and thrown to jail. But the turn is that mersault shows no guilt, no remorse over the loss of life of both his mother and the man he killed. He further says he doesn't belive 
in god when the magistrate suggests he put his faith there. Mersault slowly adjusts to his  prison world, away from the materialistic possessions of life.
Soon he faces trial, where he renounces and says to the chaplain that life for him has no greater purpose nor meaning other than the physical entity that
he is trapped in. There is no further sense to his living and he believes in the â€œgentle indifference of the world" which makes him feel relieved and happy.</font>

disgust due to his actions. Amy is found missing on her 5th anniversary and her husband along with the police try to fill
