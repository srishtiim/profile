<p>I started my schooling in Amity Noida continued it in <br>
Amity 46, Gurgaon and completed my final grades through<br>
 Amity Pushp Vihar.</br></p>

<p>My main subjects in class 11th and 12th were pcm i.e.<br>
i selected science as my stream. Safe to say it was not an easy subject<br>
and required thorough studying, practice and revision.</br></p>

<p>Chapters completed in different subjects are as follows<p>
