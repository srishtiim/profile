<h2>Good Will Hunting</h2><br>Director-Gus Van Sant</br>
 <font size="4"> Good Will Hunting is an inspirational movie about a boy who works as a janitor at MIT. He's an 
undiscovered genius at mathematics which comes in light to his professor. The professor wants him 
to reach his potential but he gets in conflict and gets arrested. He's let out on a provision only if he 
goes to therapy. But after several therapists fail to talk to him, the professor calls his old friend 
to speak to him. It's a beautiful and touching life lesson about how the human mind works 
   and the kindness of a stranger turned friend. </font>
